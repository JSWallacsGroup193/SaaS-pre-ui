## Hydronic/Boiler Calculators Added

### 1. **Expansion Tank Sizer** 💧
- **Purpose:** Calculate required expansion tank size for closed hydronic systems
- **Features:**
  - Full engineering calculation based on water expansion and pressure acceptance
  - Inputs: System volume, fill pressure, max pressure, fill temp, max operating temp
  - Calculates expansion rate (approximately 2% per 100°F)
  - Determines acceptance factor: (Pmax - Pfill) / (Pmax + 14.7 psi)
  - Recommends minimum tank size (rounded up for safety)
  - System volume estimation guide included
  - Standard tank sizes: 2, 4.5, 8, 15, 30, 60 gallons
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/FieldTools/components/ExpansionTankSizer.tsx`

**Science Behind It:**
- Water expands approximately **0.02% per °F** temperature rise
- Closed systems require expansion tank to accept expanded volume without over-pressurizing
- Tank sizing formula: `Tank Size = Expansion Volume / Acceptance Factor`
- Acceptance factor depends on fill pressure and relief valve setting
- Example: 50 gal system, 70°F→180°F (110°F rise) = ~1.1 gal expansion = ~8-15 gal tank needed

### 2. **Hydronic Flow Calculator** 🌊
- **Purpose:** Calculate required flow rate (GPM) and pump sizing for hydronic heating/cooling systems
- **Features:**
  - Based on industry-standard formula: **GPM = BTU/hr ÷ (500 × ΔT)**
  - Inputs: Heating/cooling load (BTU/hr), Temperature differential (ΔT)
  - Calculates exact flow rate in GPM
  - Suggests pump size based on calculated GPM:
    - Small (1/12 - 1/8 HP): ≤ 3 GPM
    - Medium (1/6 - 1/4 HP): 3-6 GPM
    - Large (1/3 - 1/2 HP): 6-12 GPM
    - Extra Large (3/4+ HP): > 12 GPM
  - Flow assessment (warnings for very low or high flow)
  - Design guidelines for different system types
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/FieldTools/components/HydronicFlowCalculator.tsx`

**Science Behind It:**
- Formula constant **500** = Specific heat of water (1 BTU/lb/°F) × 60 min/hr × 8.33 lb/gal
- Higher ΔT = Lower flow rate (smaller pump, smaller pipes)
- Lower ΔT = Higher flow rate (larger pump, better heat transfer)
- Typical ΔT ranges:
  - **Radiant floor**: 10-15°F (gentle, even heat)
  - **Baseboard/radiators**: 20-30°F (higher capacity)
  - **Fan coils**: 15-20°F (forced convection)

### 3. **Radiant Floor Heating Calculator** 🏠
- **Purpose:** Design radiant floor heating systems with proper tube spacing and flow requirements
- **Features:**
  - Inputs: Room area, heat loss, floor type, supply water temperature
  - Calculates optimal tube spacing:
    - **6" spacing**: High output (>30 BTU/hr/ft²)
    - **9" spacing**: Medium output (20-30 BTU/hr/ft²)
    - **12" spacing**: Standard output (<20 BTU/hr/ft²)
  - Determines total tube length needed
  - Calculates required flow rate (GPM)
  - Estimates floor surface temperature
  - Floor type selection: Concrete slab, wood frame, tile over concrete
  - Comprehensive design guidelines
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/FieldTools/components/RadiantHeatingCalculator.tsx`

**Science Behind It:**
- Floor output capacity: 15-35 BTU/hr/ft² (depends on spacing and water temp)
- Closer tube spacing = higher output per square foot
- Floor type affects heat transfer:
  - **Concrete**: Best thermal conductivity, highest output, large thermal mass
  - **Wood**: Lower conductivity, limit supply temp to 100-110°F to prevent damage
  - **Tile**: Excellent conductivity, comfortable underfoot
- Maximum surface temperature: **85°F** (comfort limit)
- Typical supply temps: **90-120°F** (much lower than baseboards at 180°F)

## Hydronic System Science

### Water Properties
- **Specific Heat:** 1 BTU/lb/°F (water absorbs/releases 1 BTU per pound per degree)
- **Density:** 8.33 lb/gallon at 70°F
- **Expansion:** ~0.02% per °F temperature increase
- **Boiling Point:** 212°F at sea level (higher with pressure)

### Hydronic Flow Formula

**GPM = BTU/hr ÷ (500 × ΔT)**

**Where:**
- **GPM** = Gallons per minute (flow rate)
- **BTU/hr** = Heating or cooling load
- **ΔT** = Temperature differential (supply temp - return temp)
- **500** = Water constant (1 BTU/lb/°F × 8.33 lb/gal × 60 min/hr ÷ 1000)

**Example:**
```
Heating Load: 80,000 BTU/hr
ΔT: 20°F (180° supply, 160° return)
GPM = 80,000 ÷ (500 × 20)
GPM = 80,000 ÷ 10,000
GPM = 8 GPM
```

**Pump Selection:**
- 8 GPM at 10 feet of head → 1/3 - 1/2 HP circulator pump

### Expansion Tank Sizing

**Tank Size = Expansion Volume / Acceptance Factor**

**Expansion Volume:**
- Water expansion: ~2% per 100°F temperature rise
- Example: 50 gallons at 70°F heated to 180°F
- Temperature rise: 110°F
- Expansion: 50 gal × (110/100) × 0.02 = 1.1 gallons

**Acceptance Factor:**
- Formula: (Pmax - Pfill) / (Pmax + 14.7)
- Example: Fill at 12 psi, relief valve at 30 psi
- Factor: (30 - 12) / (30 + 14.7) = 18 / 44.7 = 0.40

**Required Tank Size:**
- Tank = 1.1 gal / 0.40 = 2.75 gallons
- **Choose: 4.5 gallon expansion tank** (next standard size up)

### Radiant Floor Design

**Heat Output Factors:**
1. **Tube Spacing:** Closer = more output
   - 6" spacing: ~30-35 BTU/hr/ft²
   - 9" spacing: ~25-30 BTU/hr/ft²
   - 12" spacing: ~15-25 BTU/hr/ft²

2. **Floor Type:** Thermal conductivity
   - Concrete slab: Highest output
   - Tile over concrete: Excellent performance
   - Wood subfloor: Lower output, needs lower temps

3. **Water Temperature:** Higher = more output
   - 90-100°F: Gentle, efficient (radiant floor)
   - 110-120°F: Higher capacity
   - 180°F+: Baseboards/radiators (NOT radiant floor)

4. **Floor Surface Temp:** Comfort limit
   - Maximum: 85°F (higher feels uncomfortable)
   - Typical: 75-82°F

**Tube Length Calculation:**
- Formula: `Tube Length = (Area × 12) / Spacing`
- Example: 300 sq ft room, 9" spacing
- Length: (300 × 12) / 9 = 400 feet
- **Use 2 loops of 200 feet each** (max 300 ft per loop)
