# HVAC Management System

## Overview
This project is a full-stack HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) management application designed to streamline operations for HVAC businesses. It offers comprehensive tools for managing work orders, inventory, customer relationships (CRM), dispatching, purchasing, and demand forecasting. Key capabilities include AI-powered chat assistance, barcode scanning, and robust reporting, aiming to provide a complete SaaS solution for the HVAC industry.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and detailed explanations. I want iterative development with frequent, small updates. Ask before making major changes.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a React application built with Vite, utilizing Zustand for state management and React Router for navigation. It features a global ErrorBoundary and a suite of reusable components (Card, Sidebar, TopBar). The application provides a seamless user experience across modules such as Login, Dashboard, Work Orders, CRM, Inventory, SKU Details, Purchasing, Dispatch, Labels, Forecast, Scanner, Field Tools, and AI Chat.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Lazy Loading**: All 21 Field Tools calculators are lazy-loaded using React.lazy(), loading only when users click on them, significantly reducing initial bundle size.
- **Route-Based Code Splitting**: Main application routes (Dashboard, Work Orders, CRM, Inventory, etc.) are code-split and loaded on-demand, improving initial page load time.
- **Component Memoization**: Frequently rendered components (SaveToWorkOrder, Sidebar navigation items) are optimized with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Loading States**: Suspense boundaries with loading spinners provide smooth transitions during lazy component loads.
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed entire `attached_assets/` directory containing duplicate project copies, old archives, and screenshots, achieving 60-80% reduction in project size with zero production dependencies affected.

**TypeScript Type System:**
- Comprehensive type definitions in `frontend/src/types/index.ts` (750+ lines)
- Covers all 69 Prisma models and backend DTOs
- Ensures type safety across the entire frontend application

**API Client Infrastructure:**
- Centralized Axios client (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`) with:
  - Automatic JWT token injection in request headers
  - Global error handling for 401, 403, 404, 422, 500 errors
  - Automatic redirect to login on authentication failure
  - 30-second request timeout
- 12 typed service modules for backend integration:
  - `auth.service.ts` - Authentication (login, register, profile)
  - `workorder.service.ts` - Work order management
  - `inventory.service.ts` - SKU, warehouse, bin operations
  - `crm.service.ts` - Accounts, contacts, leads, notes
  - `purchasing.service.ts` - Purchase order management
  - `dispatch.service.ts` - Technician scheduling
  - `forecast.service.ts` - Demand forecasting
  - `field-calculation.service.ts` - HVAC calculator results
  - `scanner.service.ts` - Barcode scanning
  - `chat.service.ts` - AI assistant
  - `monitoring.service.ts` - Health checks and metrics

**State Management:**
- Enhanced Zustand stores with full TypeScript support:
  - `useAuthStore` - Authentication state, login/logout, user profile
  - `useWorkOrderStore` - Work order CRUD operations, status updates
  - `useInventoryStore` - SKU/warehouse/bin management with pagination
  - `useCRMStore` - Account/contact/lead/note management
- Each store includes loading states, error handling, and optimistic updates

**Authentication System:**
- React Auth Context (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Protected route component for authenticated pages
- Public route component (redirects authenticated users)
- Token persistence in localStorage
- Automatic user profile loading on app initialization

**Environment Configuration:**
- Development: API proxied through Vite dev server (`/api/v1` â†’ `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`)
- Production: Direct API calls to `/api/v1`
- Vite config optimized for Replit (port 5000, host 0.0.0.0, allowedHosts: true)

### Technical Implementations
The backend is developed with NestJS and TypeScript, using Prisma as the ORM for a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates JWT-based authentication, a multi-tenant architecture, and role-based access control. Core modules handle Work Order Management, CRM, Inventory Tracking (SKUs, Warehouses, Bins, Stock Ledger with on-hand quantity), Purchasing, Dispatch Scheduling, and Demand Forecasting. A barcode scanner module supports exact and fuzzy SKU matching. The system includes a queue module for background job processing, health and metrics endpoints for monitoring, and API versioning (`/api/v1`) with Swagger UI for documentation. The frontend is configured with Vite for TypeScript support and environment variable handling.
