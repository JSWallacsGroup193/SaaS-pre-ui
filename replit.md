# HVAC Management System

## Overview
This project is a full-stack HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) management application. It provides comprehensive tools for managing work orders, inventory, customer relationships (CRM), dispatching, purchasing, and demand forecasting. The system aims to streamline operations for HVAC businesses, offering features like AI-powered chat assistance, barcode scanning, and robust reporting.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and detailed explanations. I want iterative development with frequent, small updates. Ask before making major changes.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React and Vite, utilizing Zustand for state management and React Router for navigation. Key UI components include a global ErrorBoundary for graceful error handling, and reusable components like Card, Sidebar, and TopBar. The application includes a login page, dashboard, and dedicated pages for Work Orders, CRM, Inventory, SKU Details, Purchasing, Dispatch, Labels, Forecast, Scanner, Field Tools, and AI Chat. The system provides a seamless user experience across these modules.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is developed using NestJS with TypeScript, leveraging Prisma as the ORM for a PostgreSQL database. It features JWT-based authentication, a multi-tenant architecture, and role-based access control. Core modules include Work Order Management, CRM (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Notes), Inventory Tracking (SKUs, Warehouses, Bins, Stock Ledger with on-hand quantity calculation), Purchasing, Dispatch Scheduling, and Demand Forecasting. A barcode scanner module supports both exact and fuzzy matching for SKU lookups, and a queue module is integrated for background job processing. Health and metrics endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) are provided for monitoring. API versioning is implemented with a `/api/v1` prefix, and Swagger UI is available for interactive API documentation.

The frontend uses Vite with proper TypeScript configuration, including `vite-env.d.ts` for environment variable typing support (`import.meta.env`).

### Feature Specifications
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and authorization.
- **Work Order Management**: Creation, tracking, and status updates for HVAC work orders.
- **CRM**: Management of customer accounts, contacts, leads, and associated notes.
- **Inventory**: Detailed tracking of SKUs, warehouses, bins, and a comprehensive stock ledger. Includes real-time on-hand quantity calculations.
- **Purchasing**: Management of purchase orders.
- **Dispatch**: Scheduling and management of technician dispatch slots.
- **Forecasting**: Demand forecasting capabilities.
- **Barcode System**: Generation and scanning of barcodes for inventory management, supporting exact and fuzzy matching.
- **Field Tools**: 8 professional HVAC calculators for field technicians:
  - **Electrical Tools**: Ohm's Law Calculator, Capacitor Test Tool, Motor Amps Checker, Voltage Drop Calculator (NEC compliant)
  - **Refrigeration Tools**: Superheat Calculator, Subcooling Calculator, Target Superheat Tool, PT Chart (R-22/R-410A)
  - Mobile-responsive design optimized for tablets and phones used in the field.
- **AI Chat**: An AI-powered assistant integrated into the system.
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and application metrics endpoints.
- **Background Jobs**: Queue module for asynchronous task processing.

### System Design Choices
- **Multi-tenancy**: Designed to support multiple independent tenants, with all data scoped by tenant ID.
- **API Versioning**: All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1` for structured evolution.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions system to manage user access.
- **Stock Ledger System**: Centralized system for tracking all inventory movements to maintain accurate stock levels.
- **Security**: Utilizes Helmet for security headers, configurable CORS whitelist, JWT authentication, and input validation with `class-validator`.
- **Development Tools**: Integration of ESLint for linting, Prettier for code formatting, Jest for testing, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Deployment

### Replit Autoscale Deployment

The application is configured as a **full-stack SaaS platform** for Replit Autoscale deployment. The backend serves both the React frontend web application and the REST API.

**Build Configuration:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ../backend && npm ci && npm run build
```

The build process:
1. **Frontend Build** - `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build`
   - Installs frontend dependencies
   - Builds the React app for production (outputs to `frontend/dist`)
   - Uses `.env.production` to set `VITE_API_URL=/api/v1`
2. **Backend Build** - `cd ../backend && npm ci && npm run build`
   - Installs backend dependencies
   - Automatic Prisma Generate via `postinstall` script
   - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript using NestJS CLI
   - Configured to serve frontend static files from `frontend/dist`

**Run Configuration:**
```bash
cd backend && npm run start:prod
```
This starts the NestJS production server which:
- Serves the React web application at `/`
- Serves the REST API at `/api/v1`
- Uses `node dist/src/main.js`

**Accessing the Application:**
After deployment, your URL will serve:
- **Web Application** - `https://your-app.replit.app/` - Full React SaaS interface
- **API Endpoints** - `https://your-app.replit.app/api/v1/*` - REST API
- **Swagger Docs** - `https://your-app.replit.app/api/v1/docs` - Interactive API documentation

**Health Check Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/health` - API health check (returns `{"status":"ok"}`)
- `GET /api/v1/metrics` - Application metrics (uptime, memory, Node.js version)

**Port Configuration:**
- Backend binds to `0.0.0.0:3000` for external access
- Serves both frontend web app and API from port 3000
- Replit automatically maps internal port 3000 to external port 443 (HTTPS)

**Required Environment Variables:**
Configure these in your Replit deployment settings:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (automatically provided by Replit)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token generation
- `PORT` - Backend port (default: 3000)
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Allowed CORS origins (optional, defaults to localhost:5000)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for AI chat feature (optional)

**Prisma Configuration:**
The backend includes a `postinstall` script that automatically generates the Prisma client:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

This ensures the Prisma client is always generated after `npm install` or `npm ci`, making deployments more reliable.

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Click the **Deploy** button in Replit
2. Select **Autoscale** deployment type (recommended for APIs)
3. Verify environment variables are configured
4. Deploy and monitor the health check endpoint

**Troubleshooting:**
- If Prisma client is missing, the `postinstall` script will regenerate it automatically
- Check deployment logs for any build errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure the schema file exists at `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
